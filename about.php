            In the ever-evolving landscape of the job market, individuals, especially those with engineering backgrounds, encounter formidable challenges when it comes to making informed and strategic career decisions. The dynamism of the job market necessitates a continuous adaptation to emerging trends, making it imperative for students to navigate through multifaceted phases during their decision-making process. Recognizing the complexities of this journey, there is a growing need for effective career guidance and support. As a response to this need, our initiative aims to empower students by assisting them in identifying their skills and interests, thereby facilitating a more informed alignment with the most suitable job opportunities.<br>

This review paper delves into the transformative role of career counselling within the digital realm, emphasizing the progressive evolution of career guidance tools and platforms. The digitalization of career counselling has become a pivotal force in shaping the future of career decision-making. By leveraging the capabilities of digital technologies, we seek to enhance the quality and accessibility of career counselling services, particularly for students in the field of engineering.<br>

The digitalization of career counselling is marked by a shift towards interactive and personalized tools that cater to the unique needs of individual users. Our review systematically assesses the effectiveness and potential of career counselling tools, with a specific focus on various aspects, including user experience, accessibility, personalized guidance delivery, and the integration of AI-driven tools. These elements are crucial in ensuring that users, especially students, have a seamless and enriching experience while exploring career options.<br>

One of the key highlights of this review is the analysis of existing literature on career counselling websites. These platforms play a vital role in providing a wealth of information, resources, and interactive features that aid individuals in their career exploration. The review critically examines the strengths and limitations inherent in various digital platforms, shedding light on areas that need improvement and innovation.<br>

The findings of this review unequivocally emphasize the transformative potential of career counselling websites. These platforms have the capacity to reshape the landscape of career guidance services by offering innovative solutions to age-old challenges. The integration of artificial intelligence in career counselling tools is particularly promising, as it enables the delivery of personalized guidance based on individual skills, interests, and market trends. The synergy of human expertise and AI-driven insights has the potential to revolutionize the way career decisions are made, providing users with a more holistic and accurate understanding of their potential career trajectories.<br>

By offering a deeper insight into the current state of digital career counselling, this review seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the future of career guidance services. The implications of our findings extend beyond academia, reaching practitioners, policymakers, and technology developers involved in the enhancement of career counselling tools. Ultimately, our initiative strives to create a positive impact on the lives of individuals, particularly students, as they navigate the intricate intricacies of the contemporary job market. Through continuous improvement and innovation in digital career counselling, we aspire to empower the workforce of the future, fostering a generation of professionals who are not only skilled but also well-equipped to thrive in a rapidly evolving professional landscape.
